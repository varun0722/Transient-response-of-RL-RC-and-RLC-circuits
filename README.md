# *Experiment 5: Experimental Determination of Transient Response of RL, RC, and RLC Circuits*

##  *Aim*
To study and analyze the *transient behaviour* of a *series R–L–C circuit* under different conditions.

---

##  *Procedure*

1. Connect the circuit as shown in the *circuit diagram (Figure 1)*.  
2. Set the *rheostat* to maximum resistance and the *auto-transformer* to zero output voltage.  
3. Switch ON the supply.  
4. Adjust the applied voltage to *≈ 70 V* and measure:  
   - Current (*I*)  
   - Supply Voltage (*Vs*)  
   - Inductor Voltage (*VL*)  
   - Capacitor Voltage (*VC*)  
   - Resistor Voltage (*VR*)  
   - Wattmeter Reading (*W*)  
5. Change the rheostat to different resistance values and repeat Step 4.  
6. Set rheostat to maximum value → Change capacitance to *140 μF* → Repeat Step 4.  
7. Compare *phase angles* using:  
   - Meter readings  
   - Phasor diagram calculations  
8. Draw *phasor diagrams* showing *I, Vs, VL, VC, VR* for all observations.
